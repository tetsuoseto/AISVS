# OWASP Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS)

This Category list is intended to help the AISVS team plan the structure of the document. It will be deleted before the standard is released.

## Next steps for reviewers

1. **Documentation and GRC** - Are there any documentation, process or GRC subjects than can be moved to [0x92-Appendix-C_Governance_and_Documentation.md](./0x92-Appendix-C_Governance_and_Documentation.md).
2. **Testability** - Are these categories testable? We want to make sure we have categories and sub-categories that are strictly testable by a seecurity tester or code reviewer.
