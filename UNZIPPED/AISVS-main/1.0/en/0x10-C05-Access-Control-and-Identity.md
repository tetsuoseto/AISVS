# C5 Access Control & Identity for AI Components & Users

## Control Objective

Effective access control for AI systems requires robust identity management, context-aware authorization, and runtime enforcement following zero-trust principles. These controls ensure that humans, services, and autonomous agents only interact with models, data, and computational resources within explicitly granted scopes, with continuous verification and audit capabilities.

| **5.2.2** | **Verify that** least-privilege principles are enforced by default with service accounts starting at read-only permissions and documented business justification required for write access. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.2.3** | **Verify that** all access control modifications are linked to approved change requests and logged immutably with timestamps, actor identities, resource identifiers, and permission deltas. | 1 | V |
| **5.2.4** | **Verify that** data classification labels (PII, PHI, export-controlled, proprietary) automatically propagate to derived resources (embeddings, prompt caches, model outputs) with consistent policy enforcement. | 2 | D |
| **5.2.5** | **Verify that** unauthorized access attempts and privilege escalation events trigger real-time alerts with contextual metadata to SIEM systems within 5 minutes. | 2 | D/V |

## C5.3 Dynamic Policy Evaluation

Deploy attribute-based access control (ABAC) engines for context-aware authorization decisions with audit capabilities.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **5.3.1** | **Verify that** authorization decisions are externalized to a dedicated policy engine (OPA, Cedar, or equivalent) accessible via authenticated APIs with cryptographic integrity protection. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.3.2** | **Verify that** policies evaluate dynamic attributes at runtime including user clearance level, resource sensitivity classification, request context, tenant isolation, and temporal constraints. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.3.3** | **Verify that** policy definitions are version-controlled, peer-reviewed, and validated through automated testing in CI/CD pipelines before production deployment. | 2 | D |
| **5.3.4** | **Verify that** policy evaluation results include structured decision rationales and are transmitted to SIEM systems for correlation analysis and compliance reporting. | 2 | V |
| **5.3.5** | **Verify that** policy cache time-to-live (TTL) values do not exceed 5 minutes for high-sensitivity resources and 1 hour for standard resources with cache invalidation capabilities. | 3 | D/V |

## C5.4 Query-Time Security Enforcement

Implement database-layer security controls with mandatory filtering and row-level security policies.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **5.4.1** | **Verify that** all vector database and SQL queries include mandatory security filters (tenant ID, sensitivity labels, user scope) enforced at the database engine level, not application code. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.4.2** | **Verify that** row-level security (RLS) policies and field-level masking are enabled with policy inheritance for all vector databases, search indices, and training datasets. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.4.3** | **Verify that** failed authorization evaluations will prevent "confused deputy attacks" by immediately aborting queries and returning explicit authorization error codes rather than returning empty result sets. | 2 | D |
| **5.4.4** | **Verify that** policy evaluation latency is continuously monitored with automated alerts for timeout conditions that could enable authorization bypass. | 2 | V |
| **5.4.5** | **Verify that** query retry mechanisms re-evaluate authorization policies to account for dynamic permission changes within active user sessions. | 3 | D/V |

## C5.5 Output Filtering & Data Loss Prevention

Deploy post-processing controls to prevent unauthorized data exposure in AI-generated content.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **5.5.1** | **Verify that** post-inference filtering mechanisms scan and redact unauthorized PII, classified information, and proprietary data before delivering content to requestors. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.5.2** | **Verify that** citations, references, and source attributions in model outputs are validated against caller entitlements and removed if unauthorized access is detected. | 1 | D/V |
| **5.5.3** | **Verify that** output format restrictions (sanitized PDFs, metadata-stripped images, approved file types) are enforced based on user permission levels and data classifications. | 2 | D |
| **5.5.4** | **Verify that** redaction algorithms are deterministic, version-controlled, and maintain audit logs to support compliance investigations and forensic analysis. | 2 | V |
| **5.5.5** | **Verify that** high-risk redaction events generate adaptive logs that include cryptographic hashes of original content for forensic retrieval without data exposure. | 3 | V |
