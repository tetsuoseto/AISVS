# 9 Autonomous Orchestration & Agentic Action Security

## Control Objective

Ensure that autonomous or multi-agent AI systems can **only** execute actions that are explicitly intended, authenticated, auditable, and within bounded cost and risk thresholds. This protects against threats such as Autonomous-System Compromise, Tool Misuse, Agent Loop Detection, Communication Hijacking, Identity Spoofing, Swarm Manipulation, and Intent Manipulation.
