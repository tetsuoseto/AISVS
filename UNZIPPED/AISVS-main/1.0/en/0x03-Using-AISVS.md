# Using the AISVS

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) defines security requirements for modern AI applications and services, focusing on aspects within the control of application developers.

The AISVS is intended for anyone developing or evaluating the security of AI applications, including developers, architects, security engineers, and auditors. This chapter introduces the structure and use of the AISVS, including its verification levels and intended use cases.

## Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Levels

The AISVS defines three ascending levels of security verification. Each level adds depth and complexity, enabling organizations to tailor their security posture to the risk level of their AI systems.

Organizations may begin at Level 1 and progressively adopt higher levels as security maturity and threat exposure increase.

### Definition of the Levels

Each requirement in AISVS v1.0 is assigned to one of the following levels:

#### Level 1 requirements

Level 1 includes the most critical and foundational security requirements. These focus on preventing common attacks that do not rely on other preconditions or vulnerabilities. Most Level 1 controls are either straightforward to implement or essential enough to justify the effort.

#### Level 2 requirements

Level 2 addresses more advanced or less common attacks, as well as layered defenses against widespread threats. These requirements may involve more complex logic or target specific attack prerequisites.

#### Level 3 requirements

Level 3 includes controls that are typically harder to implement or situational in applicability. These often represent defense-in-depth mechanisms or mitigations against niche, targeted, or high-complexity attacks.

### Role (D/V)

Each AISVS requirement is marked according to the primary audience:

* D – Developer-focused requirements
* V – Verifier/auditor-focused requirements
* D/V – Relevant to both developers and verifiers
