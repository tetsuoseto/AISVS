# C4 Infrastructure, Configuration, and Deployment Security

## Control Objective

AI infrastructure must be fortified against privilege escalation, supply chain tampering, and lateral movement by employing secure configurations, runtime isolation, trusted deployment pipelines, and comprehensive monitoring. Only authorized and validated infrastructure components and configurations should reach production through controlled processes that ensure security, integrity, and auditability.

Core Security Goal: Only cryptographically signed and vulnerability-scanned infrastructure components should reach production through automated validation pipelines that enforce security policies and maintain immutable audit trails.
