# C8 Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security

## Control Objective

Embeddings and vector stores serve as the "live memory" of modern AI systems, continuously absorbing user-provided data and reintegrating it into model contexts through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). If left unregulated, this memory can leak Personally Identifiable Information (PII), breach consent, or be reverse-engineered to reconstruct the original text. The goal of this control category is to secure memory pipelines and vector databases by enforcing least-privilege access, ensuring embeddings preserve privacy, enabling stored vectors to expire or be revoked on demand, and preventing one user’s memory from contaminating another user’s prompts or completions.

## C8.1 Access Controls on Memory and RAG Indices

Enforce precise access controls on every vector collection.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                           | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.1.1 | Verify that row- and namespace-level access control rules restrict insert, delete, and query operations for each tenant, collection, or document tag. |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.2 | Verify that API keys or JWTs include scoped claims (e.g., collection IDs, action verbs) and are rotated at least quarterly.                           |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.3 | Verify that privilege escalation attempts (e.g., cross-namespace similarity queries) are detected and logged in a SIEM within 5 minutes.              |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.4 | Verify that the vector database audit logs include the subject identifier, operation, vector ID/namespace, similarity threshold, and result count.    |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.5 | Ensure that access decisions are tested for bypass vulnerabilities whenever engines are upgraded or index-sharding rules are modified.                |   3   |  V   |

## C8.2 Embedding Sanitization and Validation

Pre-screen text for PII, redact or pseudonymize it before vectorization, and optionally post-process embeddings to remove residual signals.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.2.1 | Verify that PII and regulated data are detected through automated classifiers and are masked, tokenized, or dropped before embedding.                                         |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.2.2 | Ensure embedding pipelines reject or quarantine inputs containing executable code or non-UTF-8 artifacts that could compromise the index.                                     |   1   |  D   |
| 8.2.3 | Verify that local or metric differential privacy sanitization is applied to sentence embeddings whose distance from any known PII token falls below a configurable threshold. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.2.4 | Ensure that sanitization effectiveness (such as recall of PII redaction and semantic drift) is validated at least semi-annually using benchmark corpora.                      |   2   |  V   |
| 8.2.5 | Verify that sanitization configurations are version-controlled and that changes undergo peer review.                                                                          |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.3 Memory Expiry, Revocation, and Deletion

GDPR's "right to be forgotten" and similar laws require timely erasure; therefore, vector stores must support TTLs, hard deletes, and tombstoning to ensure revoked vectors cannot be recovered or re-indexed.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Level | Role |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.3.1 | Ensure that every vector and metadata record has a TTL or an explicit retention label that is respected by automated cleanup processes.                       |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.2 | Verify that user-initiated deletion requests remove vectors, metadata, cache copies, and derivative indices within 30 days.                                   |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.3 | Verify that logical deletions are followed by cryptographic shredding of storage blocks if supported by the hardware, or by destruction of the key-vault key. |   2   |  D   |
| 8.3.4 | Verify that expired vectors are excluded from nearest-neighbor search results within 500 ms after expiration.                                                 |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.4 Prevent Embedding Inversion and Leakage

Recent defenses—noise superposition, projection networks, privacy-neuron perturbation, and application-layer encryption—can reduce token-level inversion rates to below 5%.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.4.1 | Ensure that a formal threat model addressing inversion, membership, and attribute-inference attacks is established and reviewed annually.                                                 |   1   |  V   |
| 8.4.2 | Ensure that application-layer encryption or searchable encryption protects vectors from being directly accessed by infrastructure administrators or cloud personnel.                      |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.4.3 | Verify that the defense parameters (ε for DP, noise σ, projection rank k) achieve a balance of privacy with at least 99% token protection and utility with no more than 3% accuracy loss. |   3   |  V   |
| 8.4.4 | Ensure that inversion-resilience metrics are included in the release gates for model updates, with clearly defined regression budgets.                                                    |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.5 Scope Enforcement for User-Specific Memory

Cross-tenant leakage remains a top RAG risk: improperly filtered similarity queries can expose another customer's private documents.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                          | Level | Role |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.5.1 | Ensure that every retrieval query is post-filtered by tenant/user ID before being passed to the LLM prompt.                                          |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.5.2 | Verify that collection names or namespaced IDs are salted per user or tenant to prevent vector collisions across scopes.                             |   1   |  D   |
| 8.5.3 | Verify that similarity results exceeding a configurable distance threshold but outside the caller's scope are discarded and trigger security alerts. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.5.4 | Verify that multi-tenant stress tests simulate adversarial queries attempting to retrieve out-of-scope documents and demonstrate zero data leakage.  |   2   |  V   |
| 8.5.5 | Verify that encryption keys are segregated by tenant, ensuring cryptographic isolation even when physical storage is shared.                         |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.6 Advanced Memory System Security

Security controls for advanced memory architectures, including episodic, semantic, and working memory, with specific isolation and validation requirements.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.6.1 | Verify that the different memory types (episodic, semantic, working) have isolated security contexts with role-based access controls, separate encryption keys, and documented access patterns for each memory type.                            |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.6.2 | Verify that memory consolidation processes include security validation to prevent the injection of malicious memories by performing content sanitization, source verification, and integrity checks before storage.                             |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.6.3 | Ensure that memory retrieval queries are validated and sanitized to prevent unauthorized information extraction through query pattern analysis, access control enforcement, and result filtering.                                               |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.6.4 | Verify that memory forgetting mechanisms securely delete sensitive information with cryptographic erasure guarantees by using key deletion, multi-pass overwriting, or hardware-based secure deletion accompanied by verification certificates. |   3   | D/V  |
| 8.6.5 | Ensure that memory system integrity is continuously monitored for unauthorized modifications or corruption using checksums, audit logs, and automated alerts whenever memory content changes outside of normal operations.                      |   3   | D/V  |
