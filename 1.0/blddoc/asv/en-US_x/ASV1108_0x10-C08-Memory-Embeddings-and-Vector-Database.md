# C8 Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security

## Control Objective

Embeddings and vector stores act as the "live memory" of contemporary AI systems, continuously accepting user-supplied data and surfacing it back into model contexts via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

If left ungoverned, this memory can leak PII, violate consent, or be inverted to reconstruct the original text.

The objective of this control family is to harden memory pipelines and vector databases so that access is least-privilege, embeddings are privacy-preserving, stored vectors expire or can be revoked on demand, and per-user memory never contaminates another user's prompts or completions.

## C8.1 Access Controls for Memory and RAG Indices

Enforce fine-grained access controls on every vector collection.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                           | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.1.1 | Verify that row-level and namespace-level access control rules restrict insert, delete, and query operations per tenant, collection, or document tag. |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.2 | Verify that API keys or JWTs carry scoped claims (for example, collection IDs and action verbs) and that they are rotated at least quarterly.         |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.3 | Verify that privilege-escalation attempts (for example, cross-namespace similarity queries) are detected and logged by a SIEM within 5 minutes.       |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.4 | Verify that the vector DB audit logs include the subject-identifier, operation, vector ID/namespace, similarity threshold, and result count.          |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.5 | Verify that access decisions are tested for bypass flaws whenever engines are upgraded or index-sharding rules change.                                |   3   |  V   |

---

## C8.2 Embedding Sanitization & Validation

Pre-screen text for PII, redact or pseudonymize before vectorization, and optionally post-process embeddings to strip residual signals.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Level | Role |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.2.1 | Verify that PII and regulated data are detected by automated classifiers and masked, tokenized, or dropped before embedding.                                                  |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.2.2 | Verify that embedding pipelines reject or quarantine inputs that contain executable code or non-UTF-8 artifacts that could poison the index.                                  |   1   |  D   |
| 8.2.3 | Verify that local or metric differential-privacy sanitization is applied to sentence embeddings whose distance from any known PII token falls below a configurable threshold. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.2.4 | Verify that sanitization efficacy (e.g., recall of PII redaction and semantic drift) is validated at least semi-annually against benchmark corpora.                           |   2   |  V   |
| 8.2.5 | Verify that sanitization configurations are version-controlled and that any changes undergo peer review.                                                                      |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.3 Memory Expiration, Revocation, and Deletion

GDPR's 'right to be forgotten' and similar data protection laws require timely erasure, so vector stores must support TTLs, hard deletes, and tomb-stoning to prevent revoked vectors from being recovered or re-indexed.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                       | Level | Role |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.3.1 | Verify that every vector and metadata record carries a TTL or explicit retention label honored by automated cleanup jobs.                         |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.2 | Verify that user-initiated deletion requests purge vectors, metadata, cache copies, and derivative indices within 30 days.                        |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.3 | Verify that logical deletions are followed by cryptographic shredding of storage blocks if hardware supports it, or by key-vault key destruction. |   2   |  D   |
| 8.3.4 | Verify that expired vectors are excluded from nearest-neighbor search results within 500 ms of expiration.                                        |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.4 Prevent Embedding Inversion and Leakage

Recent defenses—noise superposition, projection networks, privacy-neuron perturbation, and application-layer encryption—can cut token-level inversion rates below 5%.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                | Level | Role |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.4.1 | Verify that a formal threat model covering inversion, membership, and attribute-inference attacks exists and is reviewed annually.                         |   1   |  V   |
| 8.4.2 | Verify that application-layer encryption or searchable encryption shields vectors from direct reads by infrastructure administrators or cloud staff.       |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.4.3 | Verify that the defense parameters (ε for DP, noise σ, and projection rank k) balance privacy (≥ 99 % token protection) and utility (≤ 3 % accuracy loss). |   3   |  V   |
| 8.4.4 | Verify that inversion-resilience metrics are part of release gates for model updates, with regression budgets defined.                                     |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.5 Scope Enforcement for User-Specific Memory

Cross-tenant leakage remains a top RAG risk: improperly filtered similarity queries can surface another customer's private documents.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                | Level | Role |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.5.1 | Verify that every retrieval query is post-filtered by tenant or user ID before being passed to the LLM prompt.                                             |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.5.2 | Verify that collection names or namespaced IDs are salted per user or per tenant to prevent vector collisions across scopes.                               |   1   |  D   |
| 8.5.3 | Verify that similarity results that exceed a configurable distance threshold and lie outside the caller's scope are discarded and trigger security alerts. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.5.4 | Verify that multi-tenant stress tests simulate adversarial queries aimed at retrieving out-of-scope documents and demonstrate no leakage.                  |   2   |  V   |
| 8.5.5 | Verify that encryption keys are segregated by tenant, ensuring cryptographic isolation even when physical storage is shared.                               |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.6 Advanced Memory System Security

Security controls for sophisticated memory architectures, including episodic, semantic, and working memory, with specific isolation and validation requirements.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Level | Role |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.6.1 | Verify that each memory type (episodic, semantic, and working) has isolated security contexts with role-based access controls, separate encryption keys, and documented access patterns.                                         |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.6.2 | Verify that memory consolidation processes include security validation to prevent the injection of malicious memories through content sanitization, source verification, and integrity checks prior to storage.                  |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.6.3 | Verify that memory retrieval queries are validated and sanitized to prevent unauthorized information extraction through query pattern analysis, access control enforcement, and result filtering.                                |   2   | D/V  |
