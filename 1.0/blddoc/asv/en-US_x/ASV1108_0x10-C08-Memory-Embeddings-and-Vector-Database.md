# C8 Memory, Embeddings, and Vector Database Security

## Control Objective

Embeddings and vector stores serve as the "live memory" of modern AI systems, continuously receiving user-supplied data and feeding it back into model contexts through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). If not properly governed, this memory can leak Personally Identifiable Information (PII), violate consent, or be exploited to reconstruct the original text. The goal of this control family is to strengthen memory pipelines and vector databases by ensuring least-privilege access, preserving privacy in embeddings, enabling stored vectors to expire or be revoked on demand, and preventing per-user memory from contaminating another user's prompts or completions.

## C8.1 Access Controls on Memory & RAG Indices

Enforce detailed access controls on every vector collection.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                               | Level | Role |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.1.1 | Verify that row- and namespace-level access control rules restrict insert, delete, and query operations according to tenant, collection, or document tag. |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.2 | Ensure that API keys or JWTs include scoped claims (such as collection IDs and action verbs) and are rotated at least every quarter.                      |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.1.3 | Ensure that privilege-escalation attempts (e.g., cross-namespace similarity queries) are detected and logged to a SIEM within 5 minutes.                  |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.4 | Verify that the vector database audit logs include the subject identifier, operation, vector ID/namespace, similarity threshold, and result count.        |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.1.5 | Verify that access decisions are tested for bypass vulnerabilities whenever engines are upgraded or index-sharding rules are modified.                    |   3   |  V   |

## C8.2 Embedding Sanitization and Validation

Pre-screen text for PII, redact or pseudonymize before vectorization, and optionally post-process embeddings to remove residual signals.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Level | Role |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.2.1 | Ensure that PII and regulated data are detected by automated classifiers and are masked, tokenized, or removed before embedding.                                                 |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.2.2 | Verify that embedding pipelines reject or quarantine inputs containing executable code or non-UTF-8 artifacts that could compromise the index.                                   |   1   |  D   |
| 8.2.3 | Verify that local or metric differential privacy sanitization is applied to sentence embeddings when their distance to any known PII token falls below a configurable threshold. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.2.4 | Verify that the effectiveness of sanitization (e.g., recall of PII redaction, semantic drift) is validated at least semiannually against benchmark corpora.                      |   2   |  V   |
| 8.2.5 | Ensure that sanitization configurations are version-controlled and that any changes undergo peer review.                                                                         |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.3 Memory Expiry, Revocation, and Deletion

GDPR's "right to be forgotten" and similar laws require prompt erasure; therefore, vector stores must support TTLs, hard deletes, and tombstoning to ensure that revoked vectors cannot be recovered or re-indexed.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                | Level | Role |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.3.1 | Ensure that every vector and metadata record has a TTL or an explicit retention label that is respected by automated cleanup processes.                    |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.2 | Verify that user-initiated deletion requests remove vectors, metadata, cached copies, and derivative indices within 30 days.                               |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.3.3 | Verify that logical deletions are followed by cryptographic shredding of storage blocks if supported by hardware, or by destruction of the key-vault keys. |   2   |  D   |
| 8.3.4 | Verify that expired vectors are excluded from nearest-neighbor search results within 500 ms after expiration.                                              |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.4 Prevent Embedding Inversion and Leakage

Recent defenses—noise superposition, projection networks, privacy-neuron perturbation, and application-layer encryption—can reduce token-level inversion rates to below 5%.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                | Level | Role |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.4.1 | Ensure that a formal threat model addressing inversion, membership, and attribute-inference attacks exists and is reviewed annually.                       |   1   |  V   |
| 8.4.2 | Ensure that application-layer encryption or searchable encryption protects vectors from direct access by infrastructure administrators or cloud personnel. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.4.3 | Verify that defense parameters (ε for DP, noise σ, projection rank k) maintain privacy at ≥ 99% token protection and utility with ≤ 3% accuracy loss.      |   3   |  V   |
| 8.4.4 | Ensure that inversion-resilience metrics are included as part of the release gates for model updates, with clearly defined regression budgets.             |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.5 Scope Enforcement for User-Specific Memory

Cross-tenant leakage remains a top RAG risk: improperly filtered similarity queries can expose another customer's private documents.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Level | Role |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---: | :--: |
| 8.5.1 | Verify that every retrieval query is post-filtered by tenant/user ID before it is passed to the LLM prompt.                                                  |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.5.2 | Ensure that collection names or namespaced IDs are uniquely salted per user or tenant to prevent vector collisions across different scopes.                  |   1   |  D   |
| 8.5.3 | Verify that similarity results exceeding a configurable distance threshold but falling outside the caller's scope are discarded and trigger security alerts. |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.5.4 | Verify that multi-tenant stress tests simulate adversarial queries that attempt to retrieve out-of-scope documents and demonstrate zero leakage.             |   2   |  V   |
| 8.5.5 | Ensure that encryption keys are segregated per tenant, providing cryptographic isolation even when physical storage is shared.                               |   3   | D/V  |

## C8.6 Advanced Memory System Security

Security controls for advanced memory architectures, including episodic, semantic, and working memory, with specific isolation and validation requirements.

|   #   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Level | Role |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :--: |
| 8.6.1 | Verify that the different memory types (episodic, semantic, working) have isolated security contexts with role-based access controls, separate encryption keys, and documented access patterns for each memory type.                                                  |   1   | D/V  |
| 8.6.2 | Ensure that memory consolidation processes include security validation to prevent the injection of malicious memories by implementing content sanitization, source verification, and integrity checks before storage.                                                 |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.6.3 | Verify that memory retrieval queries are validated and sanitized to prevent the extraction of unauthorized information through query pattern analysis, access control enforcement, and result filtering.                                                              |   2   | D/V  |
| 8.6.4 | Ensure that memory forgetting mechanisms securely erase sensitive information by providing cryptographic erasure guarantees through methods such as key deletion, multi-pass overwriting, or hardware-based secure deletion accompanied by verification certificates. |   3   | D/V  |
| 8.6.5 | Verify that the memory system integrity is continuously monitored for unauthorized modifications or corruption using checksums, audit logs, and automated alerts when memory content changes outside of normal operations.                                            |   3   | D/V  |
