# 9 Autonomous Orchestration & Agentic Action Security

## Control Objective

Ensure that autonomous or multi-agent AI systems can only perform actions that are explicitly intended, authenticated, auditable, and within defined cost and risk limits. This safeguards against threats such as autonomous system compromise, tool misuse, agent loop detection, communication hijacking, identity spoofing, swarm manipulation, and intent manipulation.
