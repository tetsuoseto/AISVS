# C3 Model Lifecycle Management & Change Control

## Control Objective

AI systems must implement change control processes that prevent unauthorized or unsafe model modifications from reaching production. This control ensures model integrity through the entire lifecycle--from development through deployment to decommissioning--which enables rapid incident response and maintains accountability for all changes.

**Core Security Goal:** Only authorized, validated models reach production by employing controlled processes that maintain integrity, traceability, and recoverability.

## C3.1 Model Authorization & Integrity

Only authorized models with verified integrity reach production environments.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.1.1** | **Verify that** all model artifacts (weights, configurations, tokenizers) are cryptographically signed by authorized entities before deployment. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.1.2** | **Verify that** model integrity is validated at deployment time and signature verification failures prevent model loading. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.1.3** | **Verify that** model provenance records include an authorizing entity's identity, training data checksums, validation test results with pass/fail status, and a creation timestamp. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.1.4** | **Verify that** all model artifacts use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with documented criteria specifying when each version component increments. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.1.5** | **Verify that** dependency tracking maintains a real-time inventory that enables rapid identification of all consuming systems. | 2 | V |

## C3.2 Model Validation & Testing

Models must pass defined security and safety validations before deployment.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.2.1** | **Verify that** models undergo automated security testing that includes input validation, output sanitization, and safety evaluations with pre-agreed organizational pass/fail thresholds before deployment. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.2.2** | **Verify that** validation failures automatically block model deployment after explicit override approval from pre-designated authorized personnel with documented business justifications. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.2.3** | **Verify that** test results are cryptographically signed and immutably linked to the specific model version hash being validated. | 2 | V |
| **3.2.4** | **Verify that** emergency deployments require documented security risk assessment and approval from a pre-designated security authority within pre-agreed timeframes. | 2 | D/V |

---

## C3.3 Controlled Deployment & Rollback

Model deployments must be controlled, monitored, and reversible.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.3.1** | **Verify that** production deployments implement gradual rollout mechanisms (canary deployments, blue-green deployments) with automated rollback triggers based on pre-agreed error rates, latency thresholds, or security alert criteria. | 1 | D |
| **3.3.2** | **Verify that** rollback capabilities restore the complete model state (weights, configurations, dependencies) atomically within pre-defined organizational time windows. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.3.3** | **Verify that** deployment processes validate cryptographic signatures and compute integrity checksums before model activation, failing deployment on any mismatch. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.3.4** | **Verify that** emergency model shutdown capabilities can disable model endpoints within pre-defined response times via automated circuit breakers or manual kill switches. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.3.5** | **Verify that** rollback artifacts (previous model versions, configurations, dependencies) are retained according to organizational policies with immutable storage for incident response. | 2 | V |

---

## C3.4 Change Accountability & Audit

All model lifecycle changes must be traceable and auditable.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.4.1** | **Verify that** all model changes (deployment, configuration, retirement) generate immutable audit records including a timestamp, an authenticated actor identity, a change type, and before/after states. | 1 | V |
| **3.4.2** | **Verify that** audit log access requires appropriate authorization and all access attempts are logged with user identity and a timestamp. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.4.3** | **Verify that** prompt templates and system messages are version-controlled in git repositories with mandatory code review and approval from designated reviewers before deployment. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.4.4** | **Verify that** audit records include sufficient detail (model hashes, configuration snapshots, dependency versions) to enable complete reconstruction of model state for any timestamp within retention period. | 2 | V |

## C3.5 Secure Development Practices

Model development and training processes must follow secure practices to prevent compromise.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.5.1** | **Verify that** model development, testing, and production environments are physically or logically separated. They have no shared infrastructure, distinct access controls, and isolated data stores. | 1 | D |
| **3.5.2** | **Verify that** model training and fine-tuning occur in isolated environments with controlled network access. | 1 | D |
| **3.5.3** | **Verify that** training data sources are validated through integrity checks and authenticated via trusted sources with documented chain of custody before use in model development. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.5.4** | **Verify that** model development artifacts (hyperparameters, training scripts, configuration files) are stored in version control and require peer review approval before use in training. | 2 | D |

---

## C3.6 Model Retirement & Decommissioning

Models must be securely retired when they are no longer needed or when security issues are identified.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.6.1** | **Verify that** model retirement processes automatically scan dependency graphs, identify all consuming systems, and provide pre-agreed advance notice periods before decommissioning. | 1 | D |
| **3.6.2** | **Verify that** retired model artifacts are securely wiped using cryptographic erasure or multi-pass overwriting according to documented data retention policies with verified destruction certificates. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.6.3** | **Verify that** model retirement events are logged with timestamp and actor identity, and model signatures are revoked to prevent reuse. | 2 | V |
| **3.6.4** | **Verify that** emergency model retirement can disable model access within pre-established emergency response timeframes through automated kill switches if critical security vulnerabilities are discovered. | 2 | D/V |
